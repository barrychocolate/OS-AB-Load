1 Download a copy of the NSPL csv from https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=fd4d376782994b1ca2316a2fd0649315
2 Update the path in the Insert_NSPL_data.sql file to point to the NSPL csv file
3 Run the Insert_NSPL_data.sql script to insert the data into the table created in step 2 of this project
4 Once the data has been inserted the script will also create some indexes.  As with before you can create your own indexes if you prefer.
